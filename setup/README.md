# elrond-tools / setup

Installation and updater script for Elrond: Battle of Nodes.

The script has the following functionality:
- Auto-install GVM (Go Version Manager) and Go (the script automatically detects if this needs to be done)
- Fetch the latest released versions of elrond-go and elrond-config
- Fetch all dependent go modules
- Builds the relevant binaries
- Automatically generate keys if no existing keypairs are detected
- Automatically copy existing keypairs if they are detected
- Automatic backups of detected keypairs
- Automatic cleanup of previous installation's log and stats files. Previous database can also be removed using --reset-database
- Automatic installation of a Systemd unit with appropriate settings
- Automatically start the node using the normal binary, using tmux or using Systemd when the installation has completed
- Support for an auto-updater that compares the current installed version vs the most recent released version on Github

   --install-auto-updater             install and run an auto-updater that automatically updates the git repos and compiles a new node binary when necessary
   --uninstall-auto-updater           uninstalls/removes the auto-updater
   --systemd                          use systemd for starting the node
   --update-systemd-units             if currently installed Systemd units should be reinstalled (e.g. if they've been updated in the repo)
   --tmux                             use tmux for starting the node
   --start                            if the script should start the node after the setup process has completed
   --stop                             stops all running nodes
   --auto-updater                     if the script should run in auto-updater node
   --interval                         how often the script should run while running in auto-updater mode
   --help                             print this help
```

## Local installation examples

Download and chmod the script:

```
curl -LOs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianJ/elrond-tools/master/setup/setup.sh && chmod u+x setup.sh
```

### Basic install: `./setup.sh`

If this is done on a VPS/instance that hasn't executed this script before GVM and GO will automatically be installed. Git repos will be downloaded, dependencies fetched and binaries built. Node won't be started after installation.

### Start after install: `./setup.sh --start`

Same as above, but will start the binary after installation is complete.

### Set display name: `./setup.sh --display-name hello --start`

Same as above, but also sets the display name for the node to "hello"

### Using systemd: `./setup.sh --display-name hello --start --systemd`

Same as above, but will also install the Systemd unit and start the node using Systemd

### Using tmux: `./setup.sh --display-name hello --start --tmux`

Like above, but node will be started in a tmux session called elrond.

Attach to the session using tmux attach-session -t elrond

## Direct installation examples

```
bash <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianJ/elrond-tools/master/setup/setup.sh) --start
```

## Auto-update functionality

First run setup.sh to install everything and make sure that the node is functioning properly (use CTRL+C to stop the node when you see that it's running properly):

`./setup.sh --start`

It's highly recommended that you use Systemd for the auto-update functionality (the script currently only supports this but I'll add tmux support soon).

If the auto-updater by any unexpected reason terminates Systemd will automatically start it back up (same goes for the regular Systemd unit managing the node process).

After a regular setup, install everything required for Systemd and then start the node:

`./setup.sh --install-systemd --install-updater --start --systemd`

## Multi-node install
The script is multi-node compatible. It will install and name nodes according to the REST API ports. The default is 8080, so it'll install the first node in $elrond_path/nodes/8080, next node will be installed in $elrond_path/nodes/8081 etc. Let's say your $elrond_path is the default (~/elrond) then the nodes will be created in ~/elrond/nodes/8080 and ~/elrond/nodes/8081 respectively.

The first time you run the script it'll look for keys named after the rest-api port in $elrond_path/keys or $HOME, so essentially ~/elrond/keys and ~/ if you use the defaults. For every node you want to install and to use an existing key pair, create one zip file for each key pair and name them according to the REST API port the node will be running on.

Let's say that you want to run two nodes and use the default settings (REST API ports 8080 and 8081).
In order for the script to correctly identify your keypairs you have to name them keys-8080.zip and keys-8081.zip and place them in $elrond_path/keys or $HOME (~/elrond/keys or ~/ if using default settings).

The script will copy the identified scripts to the correct node folders in $elrond_path/nodes/REST_API_PORT/node/config (e.g. ~/elrond/nodes/8080/node/config and ~/elrond/nodes/8081/node/config for default installations).
